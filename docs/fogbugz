=======

Install Notes
-------------

  1.  Requires FogBugz version 6.1 or above, and your FogBugz installation
      must be accessible from the internet
      
  2.  "cvssubmit_url" is the url to the cvsSubmit.[php|asp] file on your 
      FogBugz server.
      Example: https://server.com/fogbugz/cvsSubmit.php
      
  3.  The "sRepo" field (in FogBugz) will be automatically set to the name of 
      this GitHub repository.

Fogbugz Configuration
---------------------

If you want to use GitHub as your sole source control system, configuration
within FogBugz is relatively easy. 

In your site configuration:

  1.  Set "the Source Control URL for logs" field to be:
      https://github.com/[github_username]/^SREPO/commits/^FILE
      
  2.  Set "the Source Control URL for diffs" field to be:
      https://github.com/[github_username]/^SREPO/commit/^R2

If you have commits in FogBugz from a previous source control system, or if
you want to use multiple GitHub accounts, please read:
